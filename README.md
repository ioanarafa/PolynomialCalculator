Design and implement a polynomial calculator with a dedicated graphical interface through which the user can insert polynomials, select the mathematical operation (i.e., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivative, integration) to be performed and view the result. 

Requirement:
• Use an object-oriented programming design (use encapsulation, define
appropriate classes e.g., Polynomial and optionally Monomial).
• Use Map for modelling the Polynomial.
• Use foreach instead of for(int i=0…).
• Implement a graphical user interface using Java Swing or JavaFX.
• Use the Java naming conventions.
• Good quality documentation addressing all sections from the documentation
template.
• Use regular expressions and pattern matching for extracting the polynomial
coefficients
• Use Junit for testing
